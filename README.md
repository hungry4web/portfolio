## Homepage
- Fixed nav bar at the top
- The buttons **place your order, contact, and work with me** all will link to one contact page - I like the concept behind the contact page on [the Focus Lab website](http://focuslabllc.com/contact) -- I'd like to do something similarly creative, though maybe less complicated

- Diner Favorites are 3 feature portfolio pieces, with rollover effects that brings the shape forward with text on top and a link to the case study page
- Button link to check out the Full Portfolio emphasized below the case studies
- The Testimonials div will be a gallery of 3-5 quotes to scroll through
- Footer with contact info, social media links and another link to contact page
- Social icons change opacity on hover

- Buttons will have 3D rollover effect from [this codrops page](http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeButtons/) like such
